    <p class="myP" >I joined Ohio State's club football team as a wide receiver in 2022. Over the next two seasons, I racked up 1,200 receiving yards and was named a First Team All-American both years. In 2023, I led the league in yards, yards after catch, yards per game, and touchdowns. It was an incredible journey, and I'm sad that this may be the last time I ever play full contact football. </p>
